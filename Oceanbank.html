                <br><br>
                <p class="AU3">Ocean Bank was founded in 1982 by a group of successful entrepreneurs and with just 14 employees. In 1983 we built and moved into our current headquarters location, which is where the trailer once stood. Ocean Bank's founders shared a common financial vision and a true dedication to making an impact in South Florida's future.</p>
                <p class="AU3">Through the years, the idea behind the establishment of Ocean Bank has remained the same. We have preserved a very special personal relationship with our clients and this practice has proven to be greatly successful. We believe in building relationships that will make a difference in our community. Today, Ocean Bank is the largest privately-owned commercial bank headquartered in Florida, with 22 branches throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties.</p>
                <p class="AU3">Ocean Bank's fundamental principles of offering exceptional customer service and quality financial products has propelled us to become a leader in the local banking industry. Since our inception, Ocean Bank has been strongly committed to serving the needs of our customers, employees and local community. As a result, the loyalty to this basic corporate principle has contributed to creating much wealth and prosperity in South Florida.</p>
                <p class="AU3">By providing capital that has helped create new products, services, and jobs, Ocean Bank has invested in the future of South Florida. We have made a substantial contribution to the development of our community by financing many of the most important real estate projects in this area, as well as granting numerous loans to local businesses. Furthermore, Ocean Bank has been the most active Small Business Administration (SBA) 504 lender in Miami-Dade County since 1995.</p>
                <p class="AU3" style="padding-bottom: 50px">Ocean Bank starts by making a difference at "home," by continuously expanding our employees' career growth and personal development opportunities. The Ocean Bank family of employees enjoys an attractive benefits package, excellent educational programs and in-house training sessions. Ocean Bank supports the dreams and aspirations of those who live, work and play in South Florida.</p>
